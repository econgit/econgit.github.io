      <description>To Start I got in R, Markdown, LaTeX because of an assignment in Macroeconomics. We have been told we could get a bonus if submitted the assignment in R writing in LaTex.Being a Microsoft Office and Stata user I knew nothing about this software and these languages.But I decided that it was time to learn.
Luckly, there is plenty of information on the net about this topic. However, at the beginning, I found more useful just to replicate the materials provided by the professor in class to get confidence with the new tools.</description>
